```php
$file = fopen("test.txt", "r+");
if ($file) {
    // ... process the file ...
    fclose($file);
} else {
    // Handle the error
    echo "Error opening file.";
}
```
This code snippet demonstrates an error handling problem. While it checks if `fopen()` returns a valid file handle, it fails to check for errors during file processing.  If an error occurs during operations on the file, like reading or writing, the code continues without noticing, leading to unexpected behavior or data corruption.  Proper error handling would involve checking the return values of all file operations, or using functions that offer more robust error handling.
